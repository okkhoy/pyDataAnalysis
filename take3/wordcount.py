Here is the word count example discussed in class implemented as a MapReduce program using the framework:

# Part 1
mr = MapReduce.MapReduce()

# Part 2
def mapper(record):
    # key: document identifier
    # value: document contents
    key = record[0]
    value = record[1]
    words = value.split()
    for w in words:
      mr.emit_intermediate(w, 1)

# Part 3
def reducer(key, list_of_values):
    # key: word
    # value: list of occurrence counts
    total = 0
    for v in list_of_values:
      total += v
    mr.emit((key, total))

# Part 4
inputdata = open(sys.argv[1])
mr.execute(inputdata, mapper, reducer)
In Part 1, we create a MapReduce object that is used to pass data between the map function and the reduce function; you wonâ€™t need to use this object directly.

In Part 2, the mapper function tokenizes each document and emits a key-value pair. The key is a word formatted as a string and the value is the integer 1 to indicate an occurrence of word.

In Part 3, the reducer function sums up the list of occurrence counts and emits a count for word. Since the mapper function emits the integer 1 for each word, each element in the list_of_values is the integer 1.

The list of occurrence counts is summed and a (word, total) tuple is emitted where word is a string and total is an integer.

In Part 4, the code loads the json file and executes the MapReduce query which prints the result to stdout.
